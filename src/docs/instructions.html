	<h2>Creating a Meme</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>On the main screen, click the "New Meme" button or go to <em>File > New Meme</em>.</li>
		<li>Select the image you want to use. Image width and height must be between 400 and 600 pixels.</li>
		<li>If the image is too big you will be able to crop or resize. If either the width or height is too small you will need to choose a different image.
		<li><strong>Cropping: </strong>Drag a box around the area you want to use. Once it is the appropriate size, the crop button will be enabled. Clicking on it will show you a preview of the cropped image.</li>
		<li><strong>Resizing: </strong>The width and height must be between 400 and 600 pixels. You can check the "contrain proportions" checkbox to make sure your image does not look stretched. If you do this, click the "Update Size" button to update the width/height, then click the "Resize" button.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Editing and Saving a Meme</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>You can add as much text as you like to both the top and bottom text areas. The size, color and font will be set for both top and bottom text areas.</li>
		<li><strong>Saving: </strong>You can save the meme by clicking the "Save" button. Use the radio buttons to select whether to save it as a JPEG or PNG image. You can also save the image by going to <em>File > Export/Save Meme</em> and selecting either JPEG or PNG.</li>
